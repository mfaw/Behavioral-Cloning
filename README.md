# Behavioral-Cloning

The objective of this project is to use deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to train a model to steer a car in a game simulator autonomously. Data is collected by driving the car in the track manually and training the neural network using this data to predict the steering angle of the car during the driving phase.

First, the simulator is used to collect data on the tracks. Second, a convolutional neural network model is built using Keras to predict the steering angle of the car from the images. Finally, the model is trained and validated.
